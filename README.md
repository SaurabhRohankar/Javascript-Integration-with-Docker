# Javascript-Integration-with-Docker
Created a GUI web portal for managing docker using JavaScript, python and html

Description ðŸ“„

ðŸ“Œ In this task I have created a Web Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS)) by showing your own creativity and UI/UX designing skills to make the webportal user friendly.

ðŸ“ŒThis app will help the user to run all the docker commands like:
 
  -->docker images
  -->docker ps
  -->docker run
  -->docker rm -f
  -->docker exec
  
  etc and try to cover the industry use cases also.
